Full tag is variable size for id3 v2.3

ID3 Header is 10 bytes (first 10 bytes of file)
- first 3 bytes are "ID3" if id3 v2.3 (0-2)
- next 2 bytes (3, 4) are the version
- next byte (5) is the flags (binary)
- bytes (6-9) are the size bits (in binary) 
	** Needed to figure out how many frames to read. 

Frames: 
- frames are variable size
- First 4 bytes of each frame are the frame ID
	- TIT2 for title
	- TPE1 - artist
	- TRCK for track no. 	
	- TPE2 - album artist
Next 4 bytes are the size
Next 2 bytes are the flags 
* I assume that the actual content follows the flags bytes.
